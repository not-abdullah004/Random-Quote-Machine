Everything is contained in a single HTML file (index.html), which includes:

Styles in a <style> tag

JSX-powered React code via <script type="text/babel">

💡 How It Works
Quotes are stored in a simple JavaScript array.

A random quote is selected using Math.random().

React's useState manages the currently displayed quote.

The Tweet button uses Twitter's intent/tweet URL to share the quote.


✅ FCC Project Requirements Covered
✅ A #quote-box container

✅ A #text element for the quote

✅ An #author element for the quote author

✅ A #new-quote button to fetch a new quote

✅ A #tweet-quote link that opens Twitter with the quote
